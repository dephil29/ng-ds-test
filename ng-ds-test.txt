Name and describe the two main operations of a stack (to add and remove data). Push is adding to the stack. pop is removing

Name and describe the two main operations of a queue (to add and remove data). enqueue is adding dequeue is removing

Draw the tree resulting from adding the following sequence of numbers to an empty tree: 30, 45, 15, 10, 50, 40, 20, 27

------------30
----15---------------45
-10----20--------40------50
----------27

Is this tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10)) yes, it is balanced.

Now add 29. Is the tree balanced? If not, which rotation needs to be done? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10)) it is not balanced. it needs a leftRotation

------------------30
-------------20--------45
----------15----27---40---50
--------10-------29

Consider the following tree:
------5
---2-----8
-1--3

Now add 0 to the tree. Which one is the first node to go out of balance? from 5 to 0

How do you fix this node? (Use the following rotation as an example: rightRotation(30), or leftRotation(10))

--------------2
--------1-----------5
----0------3-----8  

What are the four main steps of mergesort?

1. divide the array in half
2. discard the half without the number being merged
3. pick a new mid point and divide in half
4. discard the half without the number being merged

Say you have a program which handles the login queue to a game server. The game server is able to log in one person every one second. Assume that one second must elapse after a person logs in with an empty queue before they are removed from the queue. Draw the state of the queue at 12:00:06, considering the following sequence of events: I have a program which handles the login queue to a game server.

At 12:00:00 Hades logs in
At 12:00:00 Ares logs in
At 12:00:00 Zeus logs in
At 12:00:00 Buzz Light Year logs in
At 12:00:02 Kanye West logs in
At 12:00:03 Taylor Swift logs in
At 12:00:03 Darkwing Duck logs in
At 12:00:04 Evil Mickey logs in.

Buzz Light Year is in the Q.
Kanye West is in the Q.
Taylor Swift is in the Q.
Darkwing Duck is in the Q.
Evil Mickey is in the Q.

What is an angular directive? instructions to the html compiler

When specifying an angular directive, you write a function which must return an object called:
a. Directive Constructor
b. Fidel y Chavez Object
c. Directive Definition object
d. Directive Object <-----------this one

What is the relationship between html, the $scope construct, and angular expressions? (Expressions are the ones that are written like so: {{quote}} ).

In order to send ajax requests in Angular, the most accepted programming convention is to create an angular:
a. Module
b. Service <--------------this one
c. Controller
d. $http

In order to create a service, you must use the following angular function:
a. angularApp.controller
b. angularApp.module <--------------this one
c. angularApp.directive
d. angularApp.factory
